修改harbor.cfg配置(这里只修改了hostname和log_rotate_size,其它的可以根据自己需要做修改)
vi harbor.cfg
## Configuration file of Harbor

#This attribute is for migrator to detect the version of the .cfg file, DO NOT MODIFY!
_version = 1.5.0
#The IP address or hostname to access admin UI and registry service.
#DO NOT use localhost or 127.0.0.1, because Harbor needs to be accessed by external clients.
hostname = 192.168.2.136

#The protocol for accessing the UI and token/notification service, by default it is http.
#It can be set to https if ssl is enabled on nginx.
ui_url_protocol = http

#Maximum number of job workers in job service  
max_job_workers = 50 

#Determine whether or not to generate certificate for the registry's token.
#If the value is on, the prepare script creates new root cert and private key 
#for generating token to access the registry. If the value is off the default key/cert will be used.
#This flag also controls the creation of the notary signer's cert.
customize_crt = on

#The path of cert and key files for nginx, they are applied only the protocol is set to https
ssl_cert = /data/cert/server.crt
ssl_cert_key = /data/cert/server.key

#The path of secretkey storage
secretkey_path = /data

#Admiral's url, comment this attribute, or set its value to NA when Harbor is standalone
admiral_url = NA

#Log files are rotated log_rotate_count times before being removed. If count is 0, old versions are removed rather than rotated.
log_rotate_count = 10
#Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than log_rotate_size bytes. If size is followed by k, the size is assumed to be in kilobytes. 
#If the M is used, the size is in megabytes, and if G is used, the size is in gigabytes. So size 100, size 100k, size 100M and size 100G 
#are all valid.
log_rotate_size = 100M
# ......
